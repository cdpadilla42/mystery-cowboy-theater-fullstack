# Mystery Cowboy Theater

## Full Stack MERN App for ordering tickets and performing CRUD operations

Mystery Cowboy Theater is a fictional single screen theater that loves showing exclusively [Mystery Science Theater 3000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_Science_Theater_3000) films and episodes! This application displays a movie selector, current ticket order, and a movie editor.

This project fulfills all CRUD operations in two areas: ticket orders and films being screened. Aftering being populated by the database, the two larger states are contained in the app component and data is shared down to the other supporting components to allow instant updating app-wide. State is maintained through two means: local storage for ticket orders and MongoDB for movie showings.

Tech used:

- React
- MongoDB
- Mongoose ORM
- NodeJS
- Express
- Custom SCSS
- Passport
- BcryptJS
- Deployed to Heroku

My aim with this project was to connect bring together React and the Express backend into one application. Since my last React app, I planned to add complexity with multiple components needing the same state data, making the project more modular, and hooking the app up with a database. Challenge with this complexity came when the order component loaded user ticket data immediately from local storage, but crashed the application when looking for movie information. Movie data was being loaded from firebase and, thus, was not readily available. A quick addition of returning null in the event of no movie data solved the issue.

## Secure Authentication

Editing movies requires being logged in as the theater owner. There are both front end and back end security measures to ensure that the appropriate user is authenticated before editing. While contained within the same project, the authentication process treats the front-end and back-end as separate entities needing to communicate with one another. The best solution for this was to use JSON Web Tokens. Iâ€™ve used Passport to implement the creation and authentication of the token that users send in request headers through axios. To ensure passwords remain secure, bcrypt was brought into the project to encrypt newly created passwords and decode login requests.
